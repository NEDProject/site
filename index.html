		<p class="lead">Initial summary of Findings</p>
        <p class="lead">Findings suggest that <b>newly qualified nurses (NQN)</b> that are already living in out of circuit placement areas are more likely to return to their home location when choosing first post career destinations. Dependent on previous exposure prior to the start of the nursing course and placement exposure; this had a significant impact on career aspirations but did not affect first post career destinations as predicted. Support and team dynamics were the most important factors when considering first post career destinations. NQN are most likely to seek employment for one year in a post that would be most beneficial to them in regard to gained experience. The purpose of this being to maximize their chance of acceptance in the future post they aspire to. Hospitals were understood to be the best place to apply for first post jobs.</p>
        <p class="lead"><em><b>Literature Search Summary</b></em></p>
		<p class="lead"><b>Destinations</b></p>
		<p class="lead"><b>Newly qualified nurses (NQN)</b> job preferences are difficult to predict due to multiple varied underlying factors as well as individual ambitions which may not be self-advancing. Hospitals and inpatient settings, specifically acute or emergency environments, are currently the most popular destinations. Rural areas are the least desirable choice. The investment in community care has created more opportunities for newly qualified nurse applications.</p>
		<p class="lead"><b>Influences</b></p>
		<p class="lead">There are ongoing structural changes within healthcare some of which influences the NQN career choice, including but not limited to policy changes. 
Direct influences include monetary gain, individual ambition, social constraints, cultural expectations and limitations, geography, gender, mentor related influences, course curriculum and current policy agendas. 
Indirect influences include job occupational environments, work colleagues, revised expectations and time constraints.</p>
		<p class="lead"><b>Job satisfaction</b></p>
		<p class="lead">The changing structures of healthcare in attempt to increase job satisfaction can sometimes also have a negative retention effect. During the first one-year transition period stress, bullying, environment and ineffective management/training structure can cause a NQN to seek relocation and/or reconsider whether they’re on the right career path. Those who were satisfied generally felt supported, valued and a sense of camaraderie with options for self-development.</p>
		<p class="lead"><b>Millennials</b></p>
		<p class="lead">The millennial generation has an increased interest in nursing (reasons unclear) but are not always welcomed by other generations partly due to modern values, moralities, influences, technological awareness and more aggressive aspirations. However, without supportive help, guidance and opportunity millennials are more likely to leave their current career so creating a serious job retention issue for healthcare services.</p>
		<p class="lead"><em><b>DHLE Data Summary</b></em></p>
		<p class="lead">Across all nursing fields the national health service recruited the majority of newly qualified nurses (NQN) with a preference for hospital positions. When considering the circuit location child NQN’s showed a preference to leave the Lancashire area to pursue specialist hospital openings. Adult nurses showed no particular interest in specialisms but appeared to prefer city locations. Mental health nurses predominantly remained within the Lancashire circuit area and no definitive distinction of choice could be clarified.</p>
